# GuessingGameEdit
Lab1 Part2 <br/><br/>

A basic game involving entering numbers to guess a random number (the range of random numbers <br/> 
can be changed). <br/><br/>

Currently, after guessing the number correctly, the code appears to skip to the <br/>
else of the if/else if statement, and I can't figure out why.
